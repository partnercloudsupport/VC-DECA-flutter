# VC DECA App

An iOS and Android app to be utilized by the Valley Christian Chapter of DECA written in Dart using the Flutter framework.

## Getting Started

You will need to have [Flutter](https://flutter.io) and Dart installed in order to build the repository. You can check out the installation instructions below.

#### Install on Windows
Click [here](https://flutter.io/setup-windows/) for the installation guide for Windows.
#### Install on MacOS
Click [here](https://flutter.io/setup-macos/) for the installation guide for MacOS.
#### Install on Linux
Click [here](https://flutter.io/setup-linux/) for the installation guide for Linux.

The [wiki](https://github.com/bk1031/vc-deca-flutter/wiki) is also a great place to get started if you want to contribute to the project, or even if you just want to learn more about the code.

## Building the App

Go ahead and download the repository.

Open up the entire folder in your favorite IDE. I would recommend IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code as they are fully supported to run and develop Flutter applications.

***Note: If you are using IntelliJ or VS Code, make sure you have the Dart and Flutter plugins installed!***

If you are being going to run the iOS version, make sure to open `Runner.xcworkspace` from the `ios` folder with Xcode and set the development team.

Running the android version shouldn't require any additional setup as long as you are just using the emulator.
